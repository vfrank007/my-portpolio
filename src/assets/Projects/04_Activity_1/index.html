            <h1>User Experience</h1>
            <article>
                The user interface is awful. First off, consumers are likely to quit the website as soon as they land on
                the main page since it is difficult to understand and has a design that suggests it could be a
                virus-infected website. This makes it impossible to explore and search for a specific item, in addition
                to the broken functionality and the absence of payment information. The website does feature an index,
                but it's not obvious if it pertains to every item displayed somewhere on the site or just some items
                that might not have a photo and designated box. Instead, three search bars are haphazardly scattered
                around the photographs, each with an unnoticeable size, color, and purpose that only serves to confuse
                consumers further.

            <h1>Content</h1>
            <article>
                The content of the website is largely utilized to market all kinds of strange appliances and gadgets.
                The website offers a sizable assortment of different products, including electronic collectibles and
                automobiles (such as bikes, scooters, cars, and bikes). The website does a good job of showing all of
                its marketable goods, but the user interface is a horrible mess.

            <h1>Grid Layout</h1>
            <article>
                The website's layout is not as user-friendly as could be expected. It is arranged in groups of boxes,
                each containing photographs and scant information on the products inside. There is no consistency in
                design due to the latter as well as the unique format of each box. The browsing experience is unpleasant
                due to the near proximity of the images and the lack of any pattern, white space, or color scheme.
                Instead of, for example, placing all the motorcycles to the left, all the automobiles in the middle, and
                all the electronics to the right, all the products are close to one another. The boxes stated earlier
                are mixed in with text links that have no color scheme, and they don't have a hover-to-show text button
                to indicate what they are for.
